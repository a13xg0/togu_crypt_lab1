# Simple permutation encryption algorithms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/a13xg0/togu_crypt_lab1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/a13xg0/togu_crypt_lab1)

This is study work for PNU university in Khabarovsk city, shows simple realisation of permutation algorithms with one and two keys.

Also here I use dependecy injection concept in pythin code, inspired by C# code style.
